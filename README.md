# Main idea / What is does?

Tool/Game providing a way to practise typing without looking at the keyboard (speed, correctness also).


# How to run?

TBD


# Functionality

1. Display block of text, mark current character. Follow what user types. Mark 'red' or 'green' accordingly. Allow to use Backspace. Allow to skip some characters.
2. Gather info about speed and correctness. Show them after completion
3. Read those 'blocks of text' from json file with more info about them. Let filter or search. Mark with difficulty: polish language, more numbers, numbers mixed with weird characters, etc.


# ToDo

1. Make full argparse thing
2. Design json with text blocks
